Task 1.20: Use the Sales_item.h file from [Informit](https://www.informit.com/title/0321714113) to write a program that reads a set of book sales transactions, 
writing each transaction to the standard output.\
Task 1.21: Write a program that reads two Sales_item objects that have the same ISBN and produces their sum.\
Task 1.22: Write a program that reads several transactions for the same ISBN. Write the sum of all the transactions that were read.

P.S. The third tasks' instructions are a bit unclear, I really don't know if the exercise wants me to check if the ISBNs that I give as input are the same or if i'm free to just add them together given the fact that Member Functions are in later chapters instead of being before this exercise.
